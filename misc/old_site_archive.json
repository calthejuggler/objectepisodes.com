I understand that I did not make the meaning of the word.\nI can, however write it’s definition as I see it.\nI am distilling the essence of the true meaning of the word, as it is used by society.\nSometimes people use the wrong word: like calling a tomato a vegetable, or calling a koala a bear.\nA tomato is a fruit and a koala is a marsupial. These incorrect uses of the word are common.\nAnd people who do use the right word, don’t know why it is the right word.\nFrom Oxford dictionary: “True fruits are developed from the ovary in the base of the flower, and contain the seeds of the plant (though cultivated forms may be seedless).”\nKoalas are marsupials because their young are born undeveloped and carried in their mother’s pouch.\nFortunately there are dictionaries and encyclopedias written by experts who define words so people can get a deeper understanding of what they are talking about.\n2. I understand that we can talk about Rastelli with the language we have today.\n100 years ago he was the prime example of a juggler and he still fits today’s description of a juggler.\nBut when you list things that were done 100 years ago as the basis of your argument of “Things that are definitely juggling,” I think you may be a little out of date with your definition."

Also it verges into magic, which also has a history of trick inventors being paid. Juggling has no such history or culture. Unfortunately Rejean St Jules muddies the water by copying both props and material in the same act, so the issues get conflated. But they are separate arguments, in my opinion."

Practically in the circus domain, it never happens that a show is put together again by a company that has not created it, so in this sense it would not be useful.\nWhen registering, you typically register a stage work with a title and at least one author. Then anywhere this title is seen by SACD in theater programs, SACD enforces the rights. You can also declare your dates in advance to help them work. You must also mention this in your contract with the presenter.\nIf you only tour small or unofficial places, or simply places that are not part of the same system, I would not recommand you go through this system. One big side is political, it has to do with the recognition if circus as an art, also as an economic activity, and then the “corporation” of circus artists can claim more support, regulations changes, etc.\nIf nobody says he’s an author by going through the author right system, nobody is going to believe that circus is anything else than a hobby or a business.\nIf somebody else makes a copy of a show under a different title, which I have never seen in circus, there might be a chance for him to run away with that. If the original author wants to sue the plagiarist, it will cost him so much compared to the lost revenue that I doubt it would be worth.\nNote that Jerome Thomas has been administrator of SACD twice (he is now finishing is second mandate). He has been struggling real hard for circus recognition since at least 25 years. He especially made that now you can see a “circus” checkbox in the declaration forms side by side with theater and dance.\nAlso note that juggling is the first circus discipline by far in terms of author right generation.\nHope this helps."

It is not unclear who is the author of the cone, if Greg is the only one who does it. So, the ”unclarity” that you speak of is not actually inherent to the situation of authorship, but to the dishonesty of the juggling world. Also, in the specific topic of the conversation, I am quite certain that in regards to the cone, most everyone still knows Greg is the author. With the triangle it has unfortunately become a bit muddy, but again, it is not unclear who is the author because of the inherent situation of when it was created and then seen. It is unclear because people have copied it and ignored credit, and ignored seeking permission. To those who ignored that initially, the situation was crystal clear."

Also to me the multiplex technique doesn´t significantly chance the concept or juggling. with toss juggling you throw multiple things up, catch them again and repeat, with multiplexes you are doing the exact same thing so in comparision with other techniques that were developed around that time and knowing the skill itself is not “new” i wouldn´t value multiplexes as significant in juggling history"

So multiplex seems to be as old of a concept as that of ”juggling” being something you do with objects (rather than singing or storytelling for an example) as this was established in the late 1800s.\nI think a bigger historical marker would be that of broken down juggling. i.e. Patterns with throws that are made by choice and not forced by an incoming object.

And if not, what is the point of difference between this two exemples?\nOn the other hand, when it comes to analysing a 10 minute act, it can be a very difficult thing to do. But what would happen if we look at it as a chain of images? We could analyse the function of colours, the lines of the patterns of the tricks and their interaction with the space like we would do with painting or architecture. I don’t know if this kind of work has already been done by someone else before, but it could really develop our perspective on juggling."

Out of all the people who were against it, no one has been more opposed to it than Jack Kalvan. That he is now the co author of something that is completely based on my thinking and arguing is pretty nuts! What is it that they say, change go through 3 stages: 1 ridiculed, 2 aggressively opposed, 3 taken as self evident. That is a spot on reflection of Jack’s development in this matter.

The 3b cascade is pretty consistent, stable and risk free compared with randomly throwing up 3 balls and hoping to catch them.

That is by Bernardo, published in 1999 in the Italian juggling magazine, and I talked about it in my paper that you read. But we can certainly revisit it. It is probably my favorite argument through out my entire time looking into this. Here is why it does not work. You can of course play soccer and all the other things casually, without the framework of a game. You can practice aspects of them with no other intent than those practices themselves. The other side of the argument is that then all juggling competitions (volley club, combat, perhaps even the IJA championships?) would then cease to be juggling, since the objective is to win the game, as you just gave that as a disqualifying factor to something being juggling."

You are forced to keep throwing at a certain rhythm, otherwise the pattern starts becoming unstable. If the rhythm becomes too off, that will lead to a collapse, either by collision, or by dropping. The rhythm is not dead set. Again, there is a time slot consisting of several possibilities, we can choose from. Within those, exists our arbitrary choice to throw. There is a small spectrum of time where we can syncopate our throwing rhythm, but it becomes narrower and narrower, the more objects are shared between the number of hands. Compare for an example a three ball cascade, where you can play around with the rhythm of throwing quite a bit, with a five ball cascade, which is much more constrained. In a three ball cascade, you only have to care about force 1. In a five ball cascade, if you decide to throw within the time restriction that force 1 provides, you might be successful in terms of that one case of throw/catch, but if you do not take force 2 into account, your throw might have been outside of the rhythm of what force 2 allows. So if both force 1 and 2 are present (which I believe when the number of objects/tasks is N+3 or more) our time slot of choices decreases significantly. Is this clear to you Jack?"

In terms of the history and culture of juggling I would agree with you, though. It was around 1890 that Cinquevalli carved this distinction into the definition of juggling, separating it from magic, conjuring and prestidigitation which were common terms at the time. He insisted that juggling was pure skill, and that the skill was achieved by practice. Before that time, it was not so clear what the methods of achieving juggling were.\nThis being said, if one compares juggling to music, i think it was John Cage that stated that the silence between the sounds in music is also music. The same could be argued about juggling, that the moments \"inbetween\" the juggling, is also juggling."

In terms of the history and culture of juggling I would agree with you, though. It was around 1890 that Cinquevalli carved this distinction into the definition of juggling, separating it from magic, conjuring and prestidigitation which were common terms at the time. He insisted that juggling was pure skill, and that the skill was achieved by practice. Before that time, it was not so clear what the methods of achieving juggling were.\nThis being said, if one compares juggling to music, i think it was John Cage that stated that the silence between the sounds in music is also music. The same could be argued about juggling, that the moments \"inbetween\" the juggling, is also juggling."

However, to do this, they had to greatly alter the shape of the bowling pin, cutting off it’s top. The following meme shares my feeling about the matter, in general.\nI agree with Erik that it really doesn’t matter to the audience for the most part, but I personally don’t like supporting the idea that jugglers used bowling pins. When audience members pick up one of my clubs, they often will comment that they thought that they were much heavier, which then occasionally turns in to comments along the line of “Well that’s not nearly as hard as I thought.” I understand this to a point, because if I saw someone running backcrosses with five real bowling pins, I’d be mighty impressed. I just feel that supporting the common notion that jugglers use bowling pins has several negative side effects and no positive ones. In fact, I go out of my way in my show to explain that what I’m about to juggle are not bowling pins or some kind of small bat, but that they are juggling clubs, made specifically for juggling.\nJust my personal thoughts on the subject."

As a result, there are certain notions about juggling that I want to dispel, or at the very least, not support. Jugglers using bowling pins and all being clowns are the top two things on that list. Secondly, being a juggling historian and museum curator, especially one that specializes in the history props, I feel that taking just a short opportunity here and there in my show to educate the audience, even while making them laugh, about juggling history is worth the effort. I may be the only professional juggler many of them ever see in person, so I want to be a good ambassador of juggling while I have the opportunity. If the audience can spend an hour being entertained and can come out also knowing a little more about juggling than they did when they got there, then I say that’s a good thing.

People know the difference between a juggling pin and a bowling pin. If you showed someone a club and asked them what it was for, they’d say juggling and if you showed them a bowling pin and asked the same question they’d answer bowling.

Seems as if David thinks the audience generally thinks the clubs are bowling pins, but Thomas seems to think they know the difference, but are unaware of what word to use when talking about them.

You say things like “What Cinquevalli and Rastelli did was juggling because they were the most famous jugglers of their time and everyone agreed they did juggling.” But I submit that this is not what juggling is, It is what juggling was 100 years ago.

These incorrect uses of the word are common.\nAnd people who do use the right word, don’t know why it is the right word.\nFrom Oxford dictionary: “True fruits are developed from the ovary in the base of the flower, and contain the seeds of the plant (though cultivated forms may be seedless).”\nKoalas are marsupials because their young are born undeveloped and carried in their mother’s pouch.\nFortunately there are dictionaries and encyclopedias written by experts who define words so people can get a deeper understanding of what they are talking about.\n2.

So i was thinking is it possible to do something like that in juggling? For example take a word, think about it architecturally and try to produce tricks based on that stimulation.

Practically in the circus domain, it never happens that a show is put together again by a company that has not created it, so in this sense it would not be useful.\nWhen registering, you typically register a stage work with a title and at least one author. Then anywhere this title is seen by SACD in theater programs, SACD enforces the rights. You can also declare your dates in advance to help them work. You must also mention this in your contract with the presenter.\nIf you only tour small or unofficial places, or simply places that are not part of the same system, I would not recommand you go through this system. One big side is political, it has to do with the recognition if circus as an art, also as an economic activity, and then the “corporation” of circus artists can claim more support, regulations changes, etc.\nIf nobody says he’s an author by going through the author right system, nobody is going to believe that circus is anything else than a hobby or a business.\nIf somebody else makes a copy of a show under a different title, which I have never seen in circus, there might be a chance for him to run away with that. If the original author wants to sue the plagiarist, it will cost him so much compared to the lost revenue that I doubt it would be worth.\nNote that Jerome Thomas has been administrator of SACD twice (he is now finishing is second mandate). He has been struggling real hard for circus recognition since at least 25 years. He especially made that now you can see a “circus” checkbox in the declaration forms side by side with theater and dance.\nAlso note that juggling is the first circus discipline by far in terms of author right generation.\nHope this helps."

I don’t see that as “writing a piece” I see it as a technical demonstration. Anyone who can build on that, and add ANYTHING one of Greg Kennedy’s props, I see as a win.

It is not unclear who is the author of the cone, if Greg is the only one who does it. So, the ”unclarity” that you speak of is not actually inherent to the situation of authorship, but to the dishonesty of the juggling world. Also, in the specific topic of the conversation, I am quite certain that in regards to the cone, most everyone still knows Greg is the author. With the triangle it has unfortunately become a bit muddy, but again, it is not unclear who is the author because of the inherent situation of when it was created and then seen. It is unclear because people have copied it and ignored credit, and ignored seeking permission. To those who ignored that initially, the situation was crystal clear."

Also to me the multiplex technique doesn´t significantly chance the concept or juggling. with toss juggling you throw multiple things up, catch them again and repeat, with multiplexes you are doing the exact same thing so in comparision with other techniques that were developed around that time and knowing the skill itself is not “new” i wouldn´t value multiplexes as significant in juggling history"

There are also references to Cinquevalli doing multiplexes with balls, in the IJA newsletter I think is the source of that. So multiplex seems to be as old of a concept as that of ”juggling” being something you do with objects (rather than singing or storytelling for an example) as this was established in the late 1800s.\nI think a bigger historical marker would be that of broken down juggling. i.e. Patterns with throws that are made by choice and not forced by an incoming object.

Like a sort of “reference to the cascade” instead of just “the cascade”. Then you have much more time to include movement, body tricks and manipuation than during a normal cascade.

And if not, what is the point of difference between this two exemples?\nOn the other hand, when it comes to analysing a 10 minute act, it can be a very difficult thing to do. But what would happen if we look at it as a chain of images? We could analyse the function of colours, the lines of the patterns of the tricks and their interaction with the space like we would do with painting or architecture.

Out of all the people who were against it, no one has been more opposed to it than Jack Kalvan. That he is now the co author of something that is completely based on my thinking and arguing is pretty nuts!

I know that walking is considered less risky than juggling, but it is hard to draw the line at exactly when something becomes risky enough for it to be part of the essance of the activity."

That is by Bernardo, published in 1999 in the Italian juggling magazine, and I talked about it in my paper that you read. But we can certainly revisit it. It is probably my favorite argument through out my entire time looking into this. Here is why it does not work. You can of course play soccer and all the other things casually, without the framework of a game. You can practice aspects of them with no other intent than those practices themselves. The other side of the argument is that then all juggling competitions (volley club, combat, perhaps even the IJA championships?) would then cease to be juggling, since the objective is to win the game, as you just gave that as a disqualifying factor to something being juggling."

You are forced to keep throwing at a certain rhythm, otherwise the pattern starts becoming unstable. If the rhythm becomes too off, that will lead to a collapse, either by collision, or by dropping. The rhythm is not dead set. Again, there is a time slot consisting of several possibilities, we can choose from. Within those, exists our arbitrary choice to throw. There is a small spectrum of time where we can syncopate our throwing rhythm, but it becomes narrower and narrower, the more objects are shared between the number of hands. Compare for an example a three ball cascade, where you can play around with the rhythm of throwing quite a bit, with a five ball cascade, which is much more constrained. In a three ball cascade, you only have to care about force 1. In a five ball cascade, if you decide to throw within the time restriction that force 1 provides, you might be successful in terms of that one case of throw/catch, but if you do not take force 2 into account, your throw might have been outside of the rhythm of what force 2 allows. So if both force 1 and 2 are present (which I believe when the number of objects/tasks is N+3 or more) our time slot of choices decreases significantly. Is this clear to you Jack?"

In terms of the history and culture of juggling I would agree with you, though. It was around 1890 that Cinquevalli carved this distinction into the definition of juggling, separating it from magic, conjuring and prestidigitation which were common terms at the time. He insisted that juggling was pure skill, and that the skill was achieved by practice. Before that time, it was not so clear what the methods of achieving juggling were.\nThis being said, if one compares juggling to music, i think it was John Cage that stated that the silence between the sounds in music is also music. The same could be argued about juggling, that the moments \"inbetween\" the juggling, is also juggling."

However, to do this, they had to greatly alter the shape of the bowling pin, cutting off it’s top. The following meme shares my feeling about the matter, in general.\nI agree with Erik that it really doesn’t matter to the audience for the most part, but I personally don’t like supporting the idea that jugglers used bowling pins. When audience members pick up one of my clubs, they often will comment that they thought that they were much heavier, which then occasionally turns in to comments along the line of “Well that’s not nearly as hard as I thought.” I understand this to a point, because if I saw someone running backcrosses with five real bowling pins, I’d be mighty impressed. I just feel that supporting the common notion that jugglers use bowling pins has several negative side effects and no positive ones. In fact, I go out of my way in my show to explain that what I’m about to juggle are not bowling pins or some kind of small bat, but that they are juggling clubs, made specifically for juggling.\nJust my personal thoughts on the subject."

As a result, there are certain notions about juggling that I want to dispel, or at the very least, not support. Jugglers using bowling pins and all being clowns are the top two things on that list. Secondly, being a juggling historian and museum curator, especially one that specializes in the history props, I feel that taking just a short opportunity here and there in my show to educate the audience, even while making them laugh, about juggling history is worth the effort. I may be the only professional juggler many of them ever see in person, so I want to be a good ambassador of juggling while I have the opportunity. If the audience can spend an hour being entertained and can come out also knowing a little more about juggling than they did when they got there, then I say that’s a good thing.

Seems as if David thinks the audience generally thinks the clubs are bowling pins, but Thomas seems to think they know the difference, but are unaware of what word to use when talking about them.

For an example Ignatov is a juggler, what he performs is juggling, even if we cannot (yet) precisely determine why that is the case. One can identify as a juggler by relating one's own activity to already recognised juggling, and in this way place one's own activity in the category of juggling."

I've tryed doing street performances with just one object. sometimes putting on tricks way more difficult than tossing 5 balls into the air, and people don't recognize it as juggling. Often I have to swallow comments such as \"That was cute, but can you juggle?\",or \"Can you \"do it\" with 3 \"pins\"?\"(juggling somehow resembles bowling...)\nThey sure have the ability to make me wonder if I'm a juggler, or I'm just stupid."
